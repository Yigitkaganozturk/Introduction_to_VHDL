# Introduction_to_VHDL
Introduction to vhdl language by initializing a simple combinational logic function.
In this experiment our aim is to understand how combinational circuits can be implemented using FPGA board BASYS 3 with VHDL language. We are expected to find a real-life problem and design a digital circuit that its output only depends on the combination of inputs to solve the problem found. Then we generate a truth table of the design and find the simplest form of the logic function and write a VHDL code that resemble the design and  using Vivado tools generate a schematic representation and simulation of the output signal regarding to input signals. In the experiment e theoretical situation is considered, in which a software company keeps track of its employees’ success. Each employee has two tasks for a week, namely writing 2 codes and checking 2 codes written by other employees. If an employee writes two codes, if two code is written whether the person checks written codes by peers or not, or writes 1 code and checks 2 codes, the person considered as successful. As a result, a combinational digital circuit resembling an employee’s success is designed.
